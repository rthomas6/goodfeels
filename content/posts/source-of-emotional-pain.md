Most emotional pain is self-inflicted. People tend to unconsciously hurt themselves through destructive mental habits. With time, we can change these habits, and this can let us free ourselves of mental self-harm. Once we understand the cause of emotions and how we are creating them, we can change the mental patterns we have built.

## Events Do Not Cause Emotions

How is emotional pain caused? At first glance, it’s obvious: shit happens, and it hurts you.

Except that’s not what happens. This misconception is a major cause of dysfunctional mental habits. It causes us to write off the origin of our emotions as unchangeable, and implies we must fight our emotions as the only chance of improving how we feel, which is one of the worst things for reducing emotional pain.

On closer inspection, we see a missing step.

* Something happens.
* **We think about it.**
* We react to the thoughts.

This sequence leads to most of the emotions we feel. This is important, because we can examine our thoughts and our reaction to them, and modify them over time.

## Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Emotions

Perception of events often has nothing to do with reality. It filters through our current emotional state, [what our mind deems important](/posts/you-are-not-your-mind), and our worldview.

>    Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions which they form concerning things. Death, for instance, is not terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death that it is terrible. When therefore we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles.
